# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

My solutions are organised by year, then language.

## 2022

### Rust

As I am actively developing my skills in Rust, I have chosen it as my language for 2022.

I did not aim for the most efficient, idiomatic or best-practice solutions. My goal was to solve the puzzles as fast as possible, while emphasising readability and adaptability to incoming changes in requirements. The metric I used to measure my own success is the difference (git diff) in the codebase between the first and second challenge of each day, excluding readability improvements.
